# ðŸ§ª Design Lab: Modular HTML/CSS/JS Experiments

Welcome to **Design Lab** â€” a personal sandbox for testing layout techniques, reusable components, and responsive design patterns using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Each folder in `/experiments/` is a self-contained page that explores a specific concept, interaction, or visual pattern. Shared styles and utilities live in `/assets/` for consistency and reuse.
